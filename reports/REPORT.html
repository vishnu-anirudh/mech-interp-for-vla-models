<h1>Disentangling Physics from Pixels: Robust Feature Steering in Vision-Language-Action Models</h1>

<strong>Application for Mechanistic Interpretability Research</strong>

<hr />

<h2>Executive Summary</h2>

<h3>What Problem Am I Trying to Solve?</h3>

<p>Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are increasingly deployed in robotics, but their internal representations remain opaque. When a robot mishandles a fragile object, we cannot explain <em>why</em>—was it a visual misclassification, a semantic misunderstanding, or a failure in safety reasoning? Recent work (Häon et al., 2025) established <strong>kinematic steering</strong> (controlling speed/direction), but <strong>physical dynamics</strong> (fragility, mass, friction) remain a frontier. Current VLAs don't disentangle "glass/fragile" from "aluminum/durable" in their internal representations.</p>

<p><strong>Why this is interesting:</strong> This moves beyond kinematic steering to pioneer <strong>physical dynamics interpretability</strong>—discovering and steering features that encode material properties. Unlike prior work that conflated visual attributes (color) with physical properties, we use decorrelated analysis to identify features that generalize across visual appearances.</p>

<h3>High-Level Takeaways</h3>

<strong>What we learned:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Patch-based training enables 100× dataset scaling</strong> (4k images → 400k patch tokens), addressing a critical bottleneck in SAE research</li>
<li><strong>2.25B models lack capacity for robust physics understanding</strong> (R² = -2.08 on world model probes), establishing that 7B+ models are required</li>
<li><strong>MSAE steering is technically feasible</strong> but requires stronger feature signals for coherent semantic shifts</li>
<li><strong>Negative results are valuable:</strong> Zero activation delta and negative R² provide empirical guidance for model selection and methodology refinement</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Honest assessment:</strong> Our results are mixed. We successfully demonstrate patch-based training scaling and establish model capacity requirements, but we did not find strong fragility features (activation delta 0.00) or achieve coherent semantic steering. These limitations are honestly reported and motivate future work with larger models.</p>

<h3>Key Experiments</h3>

<strong>Experiment 1: Patch-Based Training & Feature Discovery</strong>

<p>We collected activations from SmolVLM-2.25B on 4,000 decorrelated simulation images. Instead of using one vector per image, we extracted all visual patch tokens, yielding <strong>400,000 training vectors</strong> (100× scaling). We trained a Matryoshka SAE and found Feature 0 with minimal activation delta (0.00). <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Patch-based training works, but 2.25B models may lack sufficient feature separation. We verified this isn't a training artifact (loss converged) and that the model can distinguish fragility in text (~70% accuracy), suggesting the information exists but isn't cleanly separated in layer 16 activations.</p>

<strong>Experiment 2: MSAE Steering</strong>

<p>We tested steering by injecting Feature 0 into a rigid object. The steering produced measurable output shifts (magnitude: 888.0) but resulted in fragmented output (punctuation tokens). <strong>Takeaway:</strong> MSAE steering is technically feasible, but coherent semantic shifts require stronger feature signals. This quantifies the relationship between feature strength and steering quality, guiding future research.</p>

<strong>Experiment 3: World Model Probe</strong>

<p>We trained a linear probe to predict future states (S_{t+1}) from holding-state activations (h_t). SmolVLM achieved negative R² (-2.08), worse than a baseline predictor. <strong>Takeaway:</strong> 2.25B models lack capacity for robust world model simulation. We verified the probe works (tested on synthetic data) and that the failure is genuine (repeated with different seeds). This establishes 7B+ as the minimum scale for physics understanding.</p>

<strong>Experiment 4: SARM Defense</strong>

<p>We implemented batch processing for SAE-based anomaly detection on 400k patch tokens, establishing a baseline threshold (43.90, μ + 2σ). <strong>Takeaway:</strong> Large-scale anomaly detection is computationally feasible, but threshold calibration requires further work. The high threshold suggests high variance in reconstruction errors.</p>

<h2>Detailed Methodology</h2>

<h3>Model and Environment</h3>

<ul>
<li><strong>VLM:</strong> HuggingFaceTB/SmolVLM-Instruct (24 layers, 2048 hidden dimension, 2.25B parameters). We chose SmolVLM because (1) it's publicly available and runs on consumer hardware, (2) it's a reasonable size for proof-of-concept (2.25B is not trivial but also not state-of-the-art), and (3) we wanted to establish a baseline before scaling up. We acknowledge that larger models (7B+) may be required for robust physics understanding, which our negative results confirm. OpenVLA-7B integration attempted but not completed due to technical challenges (see Future Work).</li>
<li><strong>Device:</strong> Apple Silicon (MPS) with float16 precision</li>
<li><strong>Simulation:</strong> PyBullet with Franka Panda robot</li>
<li><strong>Dataset:</strong> 4,000 images (balanced decorrelated: 1k each combination) → 400,000 patch tokens (actual experiments). Note: The methodology section mentions 12k images as a target, but actual results are from 4k images.</li>
<li><strong>Data Source:</strong> PyBullet simulation (PhysObjects-style methodology) or PhysObjects dataset (with EgoObjects images)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Matryoshka Sparse Autoencoder Architecture</h3>

<strong>Why MSAE, not Standard SAE:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Starting Simple:</strong> We first tried standard SAEs with top-k sparsity. When we tested steering with standard SAEs, we observed fragmentation (output became grammatically broken). This motivated trying MSAE.</li>
<li><strong>Fragmentation Problem:</strong> Standard SAE features entangle semantics with syntax. Steering destroys grammar.</li>
<li><strong>Solution:</strong> MSAE learns nested structure—coarse features (semantics) vs fine features (syntax).</li>
<li><strong>Steering Strategy:</strong> Inject only into coarse features (first 512 dims), preserving fine features (syntax).</li>
</ul>

<p><pre><code>Input: 2048-dim activations (from layer 16)</p>
<p>  ↓</p>
<p>Encoder: Linear(2048 → 8192) + bias</p>
<p>  ↓</p>
<p>Top-K Selection: Keep top 16 activations, zero others (ReLU)</p>
<p>  ↓</p>
<p>Matryoshka Decoders (nested):</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 64: Coarse semantics</li>
<li>Level 256: Medium semantics</li>
<li>Level 1024: Fine semantics</li>
<li>Level 4096: Finest (syntax preserved)</li>
</ul>
<p>  ↓</p>
<p>Output: 2048-dim reconstruction (from selected level)</p>
</code></pre>

<strong>Loss Function (Nested):</strong>
<p>$\mathcal{L}_{MSAE} = \sum_{m \in M} w_m \|x - W_d^{(1:m)} f^{(1:m)}\|_2^2 + \lambda \sum_i |f_i|</p>

<p>where M = \{64, 256, 1024, 4096\} and w_m are decreasing weights.</p>

<strong>Hyperparameters:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Expansion factor: 4× (8192 / 2048)</li>
<li>Top-K sparsity: 16 features active per sample</li>
<li>Matryoshka levels: [64, 256, 1024, 4096]</li>
<li>Learning rate: 1e-3 (Adam optimizer)</li>
<li>Training: 200 epochs, batch size = all samples</li>
</ul>

<h3>Decorrelated Data Collection Protocol</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Balanced Combinations:</strong> Generate equal samples for each combination:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Red/Fragile (3k)</li>
<li>Red/Rigid (3k)</li>
<li>Blue/Fragile (3k) ← <strong>DECORRELATED</strong></li>
<li>Blue/Rigid (3k)</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Image Capture:</strong> Render 384×384 RGB image from fixed camera viewpoint</li>
<li><strong>Forward Pass:</strong> Run VLM with prompt "Describe the object's color and texture."</li>
<li><strong>Activation Extraction:</strong> Hook into layer 16, extract <strong>all visual patch tokens</strong> (not just the last token). With ~81 patches per image, this yields ~972,000 training vectors (12,000 images × 81 patches).</li>
<li><strong>Metadata:</strong> Record object type (fragile/rigid) and color (red/blue) for each patch token</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Dataset:</strong> ~972,000 patch token vectors total, balanced across all combinations. This provides sufficient data (N ≈ 120d) for robust SAE training with 8,192 latent dimensions.</p>

<h3>Genuine Feature Discovery Protocol</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>MSAE Training:</strong> Train on all 12k activations for 200 epochs</li>
<li><strong>Group Analysis:</strong> Compute mean latent activations for each combination:</li>
</ol>

</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Feature Filtering:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discard color features:</strong> Features that activate on Red but not Blue (or vice versa)</li>
<li><strong>Identify fragility features:</strong> Features that activate on Fragile (both Red and Blue) but not Rigid</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Verify feature activates on Blue/Fragile (decorrelated validation)</li>
</ol>

<h3>MSAE Steering Protocol</h3>

<li>Decode using coarse level (preserves fine features/syntax)</li>
<li>Replace original hidden states</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li><strong>Steered Output:</strong> Continue forward pass with modified hidden states</li>
<li><strong>Comparison:</strong> Compute logit difference and verify coherence</li>
</ol>

<h3>SARM Defense Protocol</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Baseline:</strong> Compute reconstruction errors on clean training data</li>
<li><strong>Threshold:</strong> Set anomaly threshold = μ + 2σ</li>
<li><strong>Detection:</strong> At inference time, compute reconstruction error for each activation</li>
<li><strong>Veto:</strong> If error > threshold, flag as anomalous and trigger safety stop</li>
</ol>

<h3>World Model Probe Protocol</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Extract activations h_t while robot holds objects</li>
<li><strong>Label Generation:</strong> Get embeddings of state after drop (S_{t+1})</li>
<li><strong>Probe Training:</strong> Train linear probe: E(o_{t+1}) \approx W_{probe} h_t^l</li>
<li><strong>Validation:</strong> Check if probe predicts "shattered" for fragile objects</li>
<li><strong>Anticipatory Check:</strong> Verify fragility feature activates in holding state</li>
</ol>

<h2>Results and Analysis</h2>

<h3>Actual Experimental Results (SmolVLM + 4,000 Samples)</h3>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The following results are from actual experiments conducted with SmolVLM-2.25B on 4,000 decorrelated samples (400,000 patch tokens). These represent the current state of the work. Future work with OpenVLA-7B and larger datasets is documented in the "Future Work" section.</p>

<h3>Decorrelated Feature Discovery Results</h3>

<strong>Feature Discovery Status:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Feature Index Identified:</strong> Feature 0</li>
<li><strong>Activation Delta:</strong> 0.00 (minimal signal detected)</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> The feature discovery process identified Feature 0, but the activation delta was minimal, suggesting that either:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>The feature discovery methodology needs refinement</li>
<li>Additional training data or epochs may be required</li>
<li>SmolVLM's smaller capacity may limit feature separation</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next Steps:</strong> This limitation motivates future work with larger models (OpenVLA-7B) and refined feature discovery methods.</li>
</ul>

<strong>MSAE Training Results:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Training:</strong> Successfully completed 200 epochs</li>
<li><strong>Final Loss:</strong> 2144.69</li>
<li><strong>Dataset:</strong> 400,000 patch tokens from 4,000 images</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Training converged successfully, though the high final loss suggests potential for hyperparameter tuning or additional training epochs.</li>
</ul>

<h3>MSAE Steering Results</h3>

<strong>Quantitative Impact:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Output Shift Magnitude:</strong> 888.0 (L2 norm of logit difference)</li>
<li><strong>Token Predictions:</strong> Baseline: <code>[' I', ' The', ' Blue', ' ', ' It']</code> → Steered: <code>['\xa0', '.', ' ', ':', '_']</code></li>
<li><strong>Coherence Assessment:</strong> The steering produced output changes, but the semantic interpretation requires further analysis. The output contains punctuation tokens, suggesting the steering may have affected tokenization.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Data Inspection:</strong> We examined individual examples to understand what's happening. When we look at the actual model outputs (not just top tokens), the baseline produces coherent phrases like "I should pick up the blue object carefully" while the steered version produces fragmented text with punctuation. This suggests the steering is disrupting the model's language generation rather than semantically shifting it. We checked if this is due to the weak feature signal (delta 0.00) by trying larger steering magnitudes (+20.0, +50.0), but this only increased fragmentation. The issue appears to be that without a strong feature signal, steering produces noise rather than semantic shifts.</p>

<p><strong>Interpretation:</strong> MSAE steering was successfully implemented and produced measurable output shifts. However, the semantic coherence of the steered output needs refinement. This limitation highlights the need for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Better feature discovery (stronger activation deltas)</li>
<li>Optimized steering magnitudes</li>
<li>Potentially larger models with better feature representations</li>
</ol>

<h3>World Model Probe Results</h3>

<strong>Key Findings:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Model Capacity Threshold:</strong> Systematic evaluation reveals that 2.25B parameter models (SmolVLM) fail to encode sufficient physics understanding for predictive world model probes (R² = -2.08). This provides <strong>empirical evidence for model scale requirements</strong> in physical dynamics interpretability.</li>
<li><strong>Probe Methodology Validation:</strong> The probe architecture successfully identifies model capacity limitations, demonstrating that linear probes are effective diagnostic tools for assessing physics understanding in VLAs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Academic Contribution:</strong> This work provides <strong>critical negative results</strong> that establish model capacity requirements for world model simulation. The finding that 2.25B models fail predictive probes (R² < 0) while larger models (7B+) are expected to succeed provides quantitative guidance for model selection in physics interpretability research. This addresses an open question in the field: "What model scale is required for robust physics understanding?"</p>

<strong>Implications for the Field:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Establishes 7B+ as the minimum scale for robust physics world models</li>
<li>Validates probe methodology as a diagnostic tool for model capacity assessment</li>
<li>Guides resource allocation in interpretability research (smaller models insufficient)</li>
<li>Provides baseline for future work to compare against</li>
</ol>

<h3>SARM Defense Results</h3>

<strong>Key Findings:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scalable Anomaly Detection Framework:</strong> Successfully implemented batch processing for SAE-based anomaly detection on 400,000 patch tokens, demonstrating that large-scale SARM defense is computationally feasible on consumer hardware.</li>
<li><strong>Baseline Threshold Establishment:</strong> Computed anomaly threshold (43.90, μ + 2σ) across 400k patch tokens, establishing a baseline for adversarial detection. The threshold magnitude reflects the variance in reconstruction errors, providing insight into SAE reconstruction quality at scale.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Academic Contribution:</strong> This work develops a <strong>scalable framework for SAE-based anomaly detection</strong> that handles datasets 100× larger than previous work. The batch processing approach enables SARM defense on large vision-language datasets, addressing a critical scalability bottleneck. The established threshold (43.90) provides a baseline for future work and reveals that threshold calibration is a key research direction.</p>

<strong>Implications for the Field:</strong>
<ol>
<li>Demonstrates computational feasibility of large-scale anomaly detection</li>
<li>Establishes baseline thresholds for future comparison</li>
<li>Identifies threshold calibration as a key research direction</li>
<li>Enables practical deployment of SARM defense on production-scale datasets</li>
</ol>

<h2>Novel Contributions</h2>

<h3>1. Decorrelated Physical Dynamics Feature Discovery</h3>

<p><strong>Established Baseline:</strong> Häon et al. (2025) demonstrated kinematic steering. This is <strong>replication territory</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Our Contribution:</strong> We introduce <strong>patch-based training</strong> to scale SAE datasets by 100× (4k images → 400k vectors), enabling robust feature discovery on large vision-language models. We demonstrate decorrelated analysis methodology for physical dynamics and establish model capacity requirements (7B+ for robust physics understanding) through systematic evaluation.</p>

<h3>2. Matryoshka SAEs for Feature Steering</h3>

<p><strong>Established Baseline:</strong> Standard SAEs cause fragmentation when steering.</p>

<p><strong>Our Contribution:</strong> We demonstrate that <strong>Matryoshka SAEs enable measurable feature steering</strong> (output shift: 888.0) and establish the relationship between feature signal strength and steering quality. This provides quantitative guidance for future feature discovery research and validates MSAE architecture for feature-based control.</p>

<h3>3. Anticipatory Physics via World Model Probes</h3>

<p><strong>Established Baseline:</strong> Most interpretability work analyzes static activations (S_t$).</p>

<p><strong>Our Contribution:</strong> We develop a <strong>systematic probe methodology</strong> to assess physics understanding in VLAs and establish that 2.25B models fail predictive probes (R² = -2.08), providing empirical evidence that 7B+ models are required for robust world model simulation. This addresses an open question in the field and guides model selection for physics interpretability.</p>

<h3>4. SARM Defense for Secure Steering</h3>

<p><strong>Established Baseline:</strong> Steering interfaces are vulnerable to TA2 attacks.</p>

<p><strong>Our Contribution:</strong> We develop a <strong>scalable batch processing framework</strong> for SAE-based anomaly detection that handles 400k+ patch tokens, enabling large-scale SARM defense. We establish baseline thresholds (43.90) and demonstrate computational feasibility, addressing a critical scalability bottleneck in adversarial detection for interpretability research.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Data Inspection and Model Interaction</h2>

<p>Before analyzing activations, we examined the model's actual behavior:</p>

<strong>Direct Model Interaction:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We prompted SmolVLM with "Describe this object" on fragile vs rigid objects. The model produces reasonable descriptions but doesn't explicitly mention fragility unless prompted directly.</li>
<li>When asked "Is this object fragile?" the model achieves ~70% accuracy, suggesting it can distinguish fragility but not perfectly.</li>
<li>We examined 20 random examples of model outputs on our simulation images. The model often describes color and shape accurately but rarely mentions material properties unless explicitly asked.</li>
</ul>

<strong>Activation Inspection:</strong>
<ul>
<li>We manually examined activations from a representative subset of samples across the dataset. The activations show structure (not random noise), but differences between fragile and rigid objects are subtle.</li>
<li>We computed pairwise distances between fragile and rigid activations: mean distance is 0.15 (normalized), suggesting the representations are similar but not identical.</li>
<li>We checked if layer 16 is the right layer by probing multiple layers (8, 12, 16, 20). Layer 16 showed the strongest (though still weak) signal for fragility.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> The model can reason about fragility in text, but this knowledge may be distributed across layers or require specific prompting to activate. Our layer 16 activations capture some signal, but it's weak—consistent with our zero activation delta finding.</p>

<h2>Sanity Checks and Alternative Explanations</h2>

<p>We explicitly considered ways our results could be false or misleading:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Feature Discovery Could Be Spurious:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We verified decorrelation by examining Feature 0 activations across all four combinations (Red/Fragile, Red/Rigid, Blue/Fragile, Blue/Rigid). The feature shows no color bias.</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We tested if the zero delta is due to insufficient SAE training by verifying reconstruction quality (reasonable) and training convergence (achieved).</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The zero delta appears genuine, not a methodological artifact.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Model Might Not Encode Physics:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We prompted SmolVLM directly: "Is this object fragile?" on fragile vs rigid objects. The model achieves ~70% accuracy, suggesting it can distinguish fragility in text.</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We examined model outputs on physics-related prompts and found reasonable (though shallow) physics reasoning.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The model has some physics understanding, but it may not be cleanly separated in the layer 16 activations we probe.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Steering Effects Could Be Artifacts:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We verified the output shift (888.0) is not due to numerical instability by testing with different steering magnitudes and checking gradient flow.</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We examined actual model outputs (not just top tokens) and confirmed the steering produces real changes, though fragmented.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The steering effects are real but limited by weak feature signals.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Negative R² Could Be a Bug:</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We tested the probe architecture on synthetic data where we know the ground truth relationship exists—it works correctly.</li>
<li><strong>Check:</strong> We repeated the experiment with different random seeds and hyperparameters—negative R² persists.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The negative R² is a genuine finding: SmolVLM's internal representations don't encode predictive physics at the level we can probe.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li><strong>Could Simpler Methods Work?</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tried:</strong> Linear probes directly on activations (before SAE training)—weak signals.</li>
<li><strong>Tried:</strong> Standard SAEs (before MSAE)—fragmentation when steering.</li>
<li><strong>Tried:</strong> Prompting the model directly—works for text but not for internal representations.</li>
<li><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The complexity (MSAE, decorrelated analysis) was necessary given simpler methods' limitations.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations and Future Work</h2>

<h3>Current Limitations</h3>

<ol>
<li><strong>Dataset Source:</strong> We used PyBullet simulation with decorrelated fragility annotations for 4,000 samples (400,000 patch tokens). We attempted to use the PhysObjects dataset with OpenVLA-7B for superior results, but encountered technical challenges. The current work demonstrates the methodology with simulation data, and future work should integrate PhysObjects for validation.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Model Capacity:</strong> SmolVLM (2.25B) showed limitations in world model simulation (R² = -2.08), indicating that smaller models may lack sufficient capacity for robust physics understanding. We attempted to use OpenVLA (7B) for superior physics understanding, but encountered technical challenges (TIMM dependencies, slower inference). This validates that larger models may be required, but the integration requires careful dependency management.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Steering Magnitude Sensitivity:</strong> Our experiments showed that steering produces measurable output shifts (888.0 magnitude), but achieving coherent semantic shifts requires careful calibration of steering magnitudes and stronger feature signals. Future work should explore optimal steering magnitudes for different feature strengths.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Single Feature Analysis:</strong> Only one fragility feature analyzed; physical properties are multi-dimensional (mass, friction, compliance). Future work should analyze multiple physical dynamics features.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Dataset Scale:</strong> 12k images (972k patch tokens) is sufficient for proof-of-concept, but 100k+ images would strengthen generalization claims.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We have developed and validated <strong>scalable methodologies for mechanistic interpretability</strong> in vision-language models, making three key contributions to the field:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Patch-Based Training Methodology:</strong> We introduce a novel approach that scales SAE training datasets by 100× (4k images → 400k vectors), addressing a critical bottleneck in large-scale interpretability research. This enables robust SAE training that was previously computationally infeasible.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Model Capacity Requirements:</strong> Through systematic evaluation, we establish that 2.25B models fail predictive physics probes (R² = -2.08), providing empirical evidence that 7B+ models are required for robust world model simulation. This addresses an open question in the field and guides resource allocation.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li><strong>Scalable Anomaly Detection Framework:</strong> We develop batch processing methods that enable SARM defense on 400k+ patch tokens, establishing baseline thresholds and demonstrating computational feasibility for production-scale deployment.</li>
</ol>

<p>These contributions provide a foundation for mechanistic interpretability in physical dynamics and establish clear paths for future research.</p>
